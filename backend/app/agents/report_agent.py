"""Report Agent - One-shot markdown report generation.

This agent takes the research brief and summarized findings to generate
a final markdown-formatted report for the user.

Future implementation:
- async def generate_report(research_brief: ResearchBrief, summarized_findings: SummarizedFindings) -> str
- One-shot report generation (no sub-agents, no iterative refinement)
- Markdown formatting
- Citation handling and reference formatting
- Report formatting based on brief specifications
