"""Supervisor Agent - Research coordination (boilerplate).

This agent coordinates the research phase by managing sub-agents and
monitoring research progress. Implementation deferred to later phases.

Future implementation:
- Interface for receiving research brief
- Research strategy decision (how to break down, which tools)
- Sub-agent delegation logic
- Progress monitoring
- Gap detection
- Findings summarization
- Return type: SummarizedFindings
